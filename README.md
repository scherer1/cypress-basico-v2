# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing 

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v18.15.0` and `9.5.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport

run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode with a desktop viewport.
run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode with a mobile viewport.
run `npm run test` to open Cypress headless mode with a desktop viewport.
run `npm run test:mobile` to open Cypress in headless mode with a mobile viewport.
